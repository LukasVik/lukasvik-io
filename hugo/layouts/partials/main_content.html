                    <p>
                        Originally from Sweden, a life-long interest in science and computers led me
                        to a Master's degree in Applied Physics from Linköping University in 2014.
                        Since then, I have been working with passion and hunger in the fields of
                        FPGA and embedded software. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Alongside my professional work I am an active contributor in
                        the open-source FPGA community.
                        I am currently the author and maintainer of three FPGA-related
                        open-source projects.
                        Please see the GitHub link or my resume below for details.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy reading, exercising and being in nature.
                        The exercise of choice depends on the season, but you will usually
                        find me strength training, ice skating or mountain biking.

                        I wrote the complete stack of FPGA (VHDL), embedded software (C++) and PC client (Python)
                        from scratch in six months.
                        Including a custom TCP link for device configuration, status diagnostics, and
                        data logging/visualization.

                        An FPGA design startup I founded with some friends.
                        I worked as an FPGA expert on some very advanced products with bleeding-edge
                        high-speed design.
                        Example projects from these years:

                        <ul style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
                            <li>Lead developer for an FPGA-based ethernet switch</li>
                            <li>Lead developer for an FPGA-based Hi-Fi audio product</li>
                            <li>Lead developer for a video headend device</li>
                            <li>Lead developer of custom FPGA IP</li>
                        </ul>

                        I also did a lot of embedded software and PC GUI development.
                        And, of course, a lot of other things that come with running a startup:
                        finance, legal, sales, marketing, etc.

                        My first job after university.
                        I had a variety of roles and towards the end I was the lead developer.
                        I mainly developed VHDL cores for image processing, but I also did
                        team leading, pre-studies, CI, etc.
