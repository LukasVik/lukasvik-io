                    <p>
                        Originally from Sweden, a life-long interest in science and computers led me
                        to a Master's degree in Applied Physics from Link√∂ping University in 2014.
                        Since then I have with passion and hunger worked with FPGA,
                        embedded software, development tools, algorithms and signal processing.
                        In 2023 I moved to Austria where I am currently based.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Apart from professional work I am an active contributor in the open-source
                        FPGA community.
                        I am currently the author and maintainer of three FPGA-related
                        open-source projects.
                        Please see the GitHub link or my resume below for more details.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since 2017 I have been running my own company providing FPGA
                        design services.
                        I provide value and expertise for my clients both as an hourly consultant
                        and through in-house design of IP.
                        I am available on-site in the Vienna area, or remote globally.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In my free time I enjoy reading, exercising and being in nature.
                        The exercise of choice depends on the season, but more often than not you
                        will find me strength training, ice skating or mountainbiking.
                        Living in Vienna, the world's capital for classical music, I am of course
                        also an avid concertgoer.
                    </p>
