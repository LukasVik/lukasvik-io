                    <p>
                        Originally from Sweden, a life-long interest in science and computers led me
                        to a Master's degree in Applied Physics from Link√∂ping University in 2014.
                        Since then, I have been working with passion and hunger in FPGA,
                        embedded software, development tools, signal processing and algorithms.
                        In 2023 I moved to Austria, where I am currently based.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Alongside my professional work I am an active contributor in
                        the open-source FPGA community.
                        I am currently the author and maintainer of three FPGA-related
                        open-source projects.
                        Please see the GitHub link or my resume below for details.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have been running my own company providing FPGA design services
                        since 2017.
                        I provide value and expertise for my clients both as an hourly consultant
                        and through the in-house design of IP.
                        I am available on-site in the Vienna area or worldwide.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy reading, exercising and being in nature.
                        The exercise of choice depends on the season, but you will usually
                        find me strength training, ice skating or mountain biking.

                        cancer care.
                        My technology stack included custom ASIC, FPGA, high-voltage electronics, embedded/PC software.
                        Sarcura went bankrupt in the summer of 2025 due to a lack of funding.

                        An FPGA design startup I founded with some friends.
                        I worked as an FPGA expert on some very advanced products with bleeding-edge
                        high-speed design.
                        Example projects from these years:

                        <ul style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
                            <li>Lead developer for an FPGA-based ethernet switch</li>
                            <li>Lead developer for an FPGA-based Hi-Fi audio product</li>
                            <li>Lead developer for a video headend device</li>
                            <li>Lead developer of custom FPGA IP</li>
                        </ul>

                        I also did a lot of embedded software and PC GUI development.
                        And, of course, a lot of other things that come with running a startup:
                        finance, legal, sales, marketing, etc.

                        My first job after university.
                        I had a variety of roles and towards the end I was the lead developer.
                        I mainly developed VHDL cores for image processing, but I also did
                        team leading, pre-studies, CI, etc.
