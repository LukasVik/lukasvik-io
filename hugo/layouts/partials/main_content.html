                    <p>
                        Originally from Sweden, a life-long interest in science and computers led me
                        to a Master's degree in Applied Physics from Link√∂ping University in 2014.
                        Since then, I have with passion and hunger worked with FPGA,
                        embedded software, development tools, algorithms and signal processing.
                        In 2023 I moved to Austria, where I am currently based.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Alongside my professional work, I am also an active contributor in
                        the open-source FPGA community.
                        I am currently the author and maintainer of three FPGA-related
                        open-source projects.
                        Please see the GitHub link or my resume below for more details.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have been running my own company providing FPGA design services
                        since 2017.
                        I provide value and expertise for my clients both as an hourly consultant
                        and through the in-house design of IP.
                        I am available on-site in the Vienna area or worldwide.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy reading, exercising and being in nature.
                        The exercise of choice depends on the season, but you will usually
                        find me strength training, ice skating or mountain biking.
                        Since I live in Vienna, the world capital of classical music, I am of course
                        also an avid concertgoer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An FPGA design startup I founded together with some friends.
                        I worked as an FPGA expert on some very advanced products with bleeding-edge
                        high-speed design.
                        Example projects from these years:

                        <ul style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
                          <li>Design lead and main developer for an FPGA-based Hi-Fi audio product</li>
                          <li>FPGA project manager, design lead, developer for a video headend device</li>
                          <li>Lead developer for an FPGA-based ethernet switch</li>
                        </ul>

                        I also did a lot of embedded software and PC GUI development.
                        And, of course, a lot of other things that come with running a startup:
                        company management, accounting, sales, marketing, contracts, etc.
                    </p>

                        My first job after university.
                        I had a variety of roles and towards the end I was the lead developer.
                        I mainly developed VHDL cores for image processing, but I also did
                        team leading, pre-studies, CI, etc.
